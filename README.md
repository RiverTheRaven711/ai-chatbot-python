# ai-chatbot-python
Source code for creating a simple AI ChatBot on your computer using Python and modules (chatterbot_corpus, chatterbot)
Note: Intended for Windows users only; although if this works on Linux and/or Apple products, cool beans. Just letting you know.

Disclaimer: The video link above was a bit outdated, and might not work out to some of you, which is why I have uploaded a new version of this code. A few pointers, though: In order to chat with the bot, make sure that you have the file saved on the same location where you keep the chatterbot_corpus folder in. And or better results, have both the chatterbot and chatterbot_corpus folders in the same directory as the folder of your current version of Python, be it version 3.7+ or lower. (Make certain of the directory settings on your computer, for when using pip3 or older versions of pip, it automatically redirects the folders into the Python folder onto the same location) If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding the process, let me know asap. No rush, just finding a way to make this work. Thank you for looking through this, and have a merry Christmas!
